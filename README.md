# C++ OOP Exercise: Rectangle & Box Types

This C++ program is designed as an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise. It demonstrates concepts like classes, inheritance, and operator overloading.

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to:

- **Practice OOP Concepts**: Reinforce understanding of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Understand Inheritance**: Illustrate inheritance with `boxType` inheriting from `rectangleType`.
- **Operator Overloading**: Implement custom behavior for operators like `+`, `*`, `==`, and `!=`.
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Encapsulate data and operations within classes.

## Usage

1. **Compile**: Use a C++ compiler to compile `test.h` and `main.cpp`.
2. **Run**: Execute the compiled program to see rectangle and box types in action.
3. **Explore**: Modify the code to experiment with OOP concepts further.

## Key Concepts

- Class Definition
- Constructor Initialization
- Member Functions
- Operator Overloading
- Inheritance
- Input/Output Operators

## Further Exploration

- Add more functionality (e.g., computing area/volume).
- Implement error handling.
- Explore polymorphism.
- Incorporate file I/O operations.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to suggest improvements or report issues.
